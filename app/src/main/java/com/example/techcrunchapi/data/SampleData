But as soon as great video conferencing software developed people started thinking more openly about labor and started hiring people all around the world.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These distributed workforces required even more organizational structure for their meetings as they collaborated on projects, Husney said.

Anyone who wishes to fly a drone owned by someone else must also first obtain a flyer ID by passing the theory test.</p>\n<p>UK ministers have come in for serious criticism for lagging on drone regulations in recent years after a spate of drone sightings at the country&#8217;s busiest airport grounded flights <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/drones-ground-flights-at-uks-second-largest-airport/\">last December</a>, disrupting thousands of travellers. In <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/08/drone-sighting-halts-flights-at-uks-heathrow-airport/\">January</a> flights were also briefly halted at Heathrow airport after another unidentified drone sighting.</p>\n<p>This fall the police investigation into the Gatwick drone shutdown <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/27/last-years-gatwick-drone-attack-involved-at-least-two-drones-say-police/\">found</a> that at least two drones had been involved. In September police also said they had been unable to identify any suspects &#8212; ruling out 96 people of interest.</p>\n<p>Following the Gatwick disruption the government tightened <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/30/psa-drone-flight-restrictions-are-in-force-in-the-uk-from-today/\">existing laws</a> around drone flights near airports &#8212; extending a no-fly zone from <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/20/uks-extended-5km-airport-drone-no-fly-zones-in-force-next-month/\">1km to 5km</a>. But a full drone bill, originally slated for introduction this year, has yet to take off.</p>\n<p>As well as introducing a legal requirement for drone owners to register their craft via the <a href=\"https://register-drones.caa.co.uk/individual\">Civil Aviation Authority&#8217;s website</a> by November 30, the new stop-gap rules require organizations that use drones to register for an operator ID too, also at a cost of £9 per year.</p>\n<p>All drones must also be labeled with the operator ID. This must be clearly visible on the main body of the craft, and easy to read when it&#8217;s on the ground, written in block capital letters taller than 3mm high.</p>\n<p>The registered person who obtains the operator ID must be aged 18 or older and is accountable for managing drones to ensure only individuals with a flyer ID fly them.</p>\n<p>Individuals must be aged 13 or older to obtain a flyer ID.</p>\n<p>The online test for obtaining the flyer ID involves answering 20 multiple choice questions. The pass mark for the test is set at 16. There&#8217;s no limit on how many times the test can be taken.</p>\n<p>The Civil Aviation Authority says everything needed to pass the test can be found in <a href=\"https://register-drones.caa.co.uk/drone-code\">The Drone and Model Aircraft Code</a>.

The Chinese electronics giant has launched its first smartwatch called the Mi Watch that looks strikingly similar to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/apple-watch-series-5-review/\">the Apple Watch</a> in its home market.</p>\n<p>The Mi Watch, like the Apple Watch, has a square body with a crown and a button. It sports a 1.78-inch AMOLED display (326 ppi) that offers the always-on capability and runs MIUI for Watch, the company&#8217;s homegrown wearable operating system based on Google&#8217;s Wear OS.</p>\n<p>Inside the metal housing &#8212; aluminum alloy with a matte finish &#8212; are microphones on two sides for recording audio and taking calls, and a loudspeaker on the left to listen to music or incoming calls. The Mi Watch, which comes in one size &#8212; 44mm &#8212; has a ceramic back, which is where the charging pins and a heart rate sensor are also placed.</p>\n<p>The Mi Watch is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 3100 4G chipset with four Cortex A7 cores clocked at 1.2GHz, coupled with 1GB of RAM and 8GB storage. The company says its first smartwatch supports cellular connectivity (through an eSIM), Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, and NFC for payments. The Mi Watch should last for 36 hours on a single charge on cellular mode, the company claimed.</p>\n<p>The Mi Watch will also help users track their sleep, performance while swimming, cycling and running, and also measure their heart rate.</p>\n<p>Over 40 popular Chinese apps such as TikTok and QQ Messenger are available for the Mi Watch on day one. The company’s own XiaoAI assistant is the default virtual digital assistant on the watch.</p>\n<p>The Mi Watch is priced at CNY 1,299 ($185) and will go on sale in the country next week. There’s no word on international availability just yet, but if the past is any indication, Xiaomi will likely bring the device to India, Singapore, Indonesia and other markets in coming quarters.</p>\n<p>The company says a variant of the Mi Watch that sports a sapphire glass and stainless steel will go on sale next month in China. It is priced at CNY 1,999 ($285).</p>\n<p>Xiaomi is no stranger to the wearable market. The company&#8217;s fitness trackers &#8212; that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/12/xiaomi-mi-smart-band-4-gadgets/\">cost under $25 and sport colorful displays</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/xiaomi-mi-band-3/\">last for weeks on a single charge</a> &#8212; are incredibly popular in Asian markets.</p>\n<p>This is also not the first time Xiaomi has been accused of taking <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/business/global/in-china-an-empire-built-by-aping-apple.html?_r=0\">too much inspiration from Apple</a>. The early smartphones from Xiaomi looked very similar to the iPhones. But in recent years, its products have carried a little more independence and originality. Well, most smartphones &#8212; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/xiaomis-mi-8-may-be-its-most-brazen-iphone-copycat-yet/\">not all</a>. Also this year, the company was accused of <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/02/xiaomi-threatens-writers-over-mimoji-apps-overlap-with-apples-memoji/\">cloning Apple&#8217;s cartoony Memoji</a>.</p>\n",

Separately, Medopad is also working on developing diagnostics to track biomarkers related to Parkinson&#8217;s, Alzheimer&#8217;s and Diabetes.</p>\n<p>The Series B is being made at a post-money valuation of between $200 million and $300 million. In addition to Bayer, Hong Kong firm <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=nws+holdings&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8\">NWS Holdings</a> and Chicago VC <a href=\"http://www.healthbox.com/\">Healthbox</a> also participated. All three are previous investors, with NWS leading its $28 million Series A in 2018, bringing the total raised by Medopad to over $50 million.</p>\n<p>The bump in valuation &#8212; Medopad had a $110 million post-money valuation after its previous round &#8212; also comes on the heels of the company last year signing high-profile deals <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/u-k-startup-medopad-signs-deals-with-tencent-and-ping-an\">totalling some $140 million</a> with a string of firms in China, including Tencent, Ping An, as well as the Chinese divisions of GSK, Johnson &amp; Johnson and more.</p>\n<p>The world where medicine mixes with tech in the name of doing things faster, better and with less expense had a big knock with the rise and calamitous fall of Theranos. The blood-testing startup claimed to have developed technology to perform a multitude of tests tracking biomarkers using only a few drops of blood &#8212; tests that used to require significantly more blood (and expense) to run accurately. Great concept, if only it weren&#8217;t a scam.</p>\n<p>Medopad also tracks biomarkers, but it&#8217;s taking a very different, non-invasive route to building its solutions. The company constructs its algorithms and tests working with pharmaceutical and tech partners to build solutions end-to-end, leaning on advances in software and hardware to fulfil ideas that have been unattainable goals for a long time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the past 25 years, we have been talking about connected healthcare, but no one has done it,&#8221; CEO Dan Vahdat, who co-founded the company with Rich Khatib, said in an interview. &#8220;The nature of the concept has just been too challenging. The approach is established but the computing and device technology weren&#8217;t able to detect and read these things outside of hospital settings.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In one example, a classic Parkinson&#8217;s test would have required a patient to go to into a doctor&#8217;s office for a 30-minute assessment to determine how a patient is walking. In recent times, with the advent of advanced computer vision and far better sensors on devices, a new category of digital biomarkers, as Vahdat describes them, are being created &#8212; for example, by tracking how a person is walking to measure her/his gait and other metrics &#8212; to provide similar guidance to a clinician on the patient&#8217;s progress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These can be collected, for example, based on how you walk and talk, along with other vital signs,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The startup is also working with teaching hospitals to build other clinical trials. For example, it has a partnership with the Royal Wolverhampton to better track Aortic Stenosis, when heart valves narrow and restrict blood flow.</p>\n<p>“This is a very exciting project and fits with our ethos of ‘proactive’ and ‘one to many care’ which, we think, will benefit patients and release valuable clinical time,&#8221; said Professor James Cotton at The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, in a statement.</p>\n<p>Longer term, it&#8217;s also working with Janssen (a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson) a possible way of tracking early signs and progress of Alzheimers by way of cognitive tests that someone can take at home.</p>\n<p>Medopad has a healthy approach to the work it is doing reminiscent of the kind of collaboration that is typical in the world of science.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t claim that we can do what others can&#8217;t, but we are using foundations that were built years ago, to discover and commercially deploy solutions via our channel,&#8221; said Vahdat. He added that Babylon in the UK and Collective Health in the UK are two companies he admires for taking a similar approach in their respective fields of doctor/patient care and health insurance.</p>\n<p>The fact that the company works so closely with Tencent and other Chinese companies is notable at a time when there is a lot of scrutiny of China and how its companies may be using or working with personal data in countries like the US and UK.</p>\n<p>Vahdat said that all patient data is only collected with consent, and if any data from Medopad is passed to its partners, it&#8217;s anonymised. A patient&#8217;s data, furthermore, does not leave the country in which it is collected.</p>\n<p>The Tencent partnership, he added, was largely to help build the company&#8217;s AI engine, with China&#8217;s massive population providing a ripe background to train machine learning algorithms.</p>\n<p>Medopad&#8217;s main asset, in any case, is not data, but the algorithms and methods it uses to collect and process digital biomarkers, he added.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are a big believer in the fact that data is not our product,&#8221; Vahdat said. &#8220;That is something we are really proud of.&#8221;</p>\n",

(Image: Freedom House)</p></div></p>\n<p>Disinformation — or &#8220;fake news&#8221; as described by some — has become a major headache for both governments and private industry. As the spread of deliberately misleading and false information has become more prevalent, lawmakers have threatened to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/us-legislator-david-cicilline-joins-international-push-to-interrogate-platform-power/\">step in to legislate</a> against the problem.</p>\n<p>But as some governments — including the U.S. — have tried to stop the spread of disinformation, Freedom House accused some global leaders — including the U.S. — of &#8220;co-opting&#8221; social media platforms for their own benefit. Both the U.S. and China are among the 40 countries that have expanded their monitoring of social media platforms, the report said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Law enforcement and immigration agencies expanded their surveillance of the public, eschewing oversight, transparency, and accountability mechanisms that might restrain their actions,&#8221; the report said.</p>\n<p>The encroachment on personal privacy, such as the warrantless searching of travelers&#8217; phones without court-approved warrants, also contributed to the U.S.&#8217; decline.</p>\n<p>Several stories in the last year revealed how border authorities would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/27/border-deny-entry-united-states-social-media/\">deny entry</a> to travelers for the content of social media posts made by other people, following <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/01/u-s-state-department-begins-social-media-screening-for-nearly-all-visa-applicants/\">changes to rules</a> that compelled visa holders to disclose their social media handles at the border.</p>\n<p>“The future of internet freedom rests on our ability to fix social media,” said Adrian Shahbaz, the non-profit&#8217;s research director for technology and democracy.</p>\n<p>Given that most social media platforms are based in the U.S., Shahbaz said the U.S. has to be a &#8220;leader&#8221; in promoting transparency and accountability.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is the only way to stop the internet from becoming a Trojan horse for tyranny and oppression,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"sS7x1PURiQ\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/05/bad-month-for-the-internet/\">It was a really bad month for the internet</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;It was a really bad month for the internet&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/05/bad-month-for-the-internet/embed/#?secret=sS7x1PURiQ\" data-secret=\"sS7x1PURiQ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n",

Times Internet is the only external investor in Gradeup, they said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gradeup.co\">Gradeup</a> started as a community for students to discuss their upcoming exams, and help one another with solving questions, said Shobhit Bhatnagar, cofounder and CEO of Gradeup, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>While those functionalities continue to be available on the platform, Gradeup has expanded to offer online courses from teachers to help students prepare for exams in last one year, he said. These courses, depending on their complexity and duration, cost anywhere between Rs 5,000 ($70) and Rs 35,000 ($500).</p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1908208\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/engineering-exam.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"649\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/engineering-exam.jpg 2290w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/engineering-exam.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/engineering-exam.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/engineering-exam.jpg?resize=768,487 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/engineering-exam.jpg?resize=680,431 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/engineering-exam.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>“These are live lectures that are designed to replicate the offline experience,” he said. The startup offers dozens of courses and runs multiple sessions in English and Hindi languages. As many as 200 students tune into a class simultaneously, he said.</p>\n<p>Students can interact with the teacher through a chatroom. Each class also has a “student success rate” team assigned to it that follows up with each student to check if they had any difficulties in learning any concept and take their feedback. These extra efforts have helped Gradeup see more than 50% of its students finish their courses &#8212; an industry best, Bhatnagar said.</p>\n<p>Each year in India, more than 30 million students appear for competitive exams. A significant number of these students enroll themselves to tuitions and other offline coaching centers.</p>\n<p>“India has over 200 million students that spend over $90 billion on different educational services. These have primarily been served offline, where the challenge is maintaining high quality while expanding access,” said Satyan Gajwani, Vice Chairman of Times Internet.</p>\n<p>In recent years, a number of edtech startups have emerged in the country to cater to larger audiences and make access to courses cheaper. Byju’s, backed by Naspers and<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/17/byjus-raises-540-million/\"> valued at over $5.5 billion</a>, offers a wide-ranging self-learning courses. Vedantu, a Bangalore-based startup that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/29/indias-vedantu-raises-42m-to-expand-its-live-and-interactive-online-tutoring-platform/\">raised $42 million in late August</a>, offers a mix of recorded and live and interactive courses.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1908209\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1908209\" class=\"breakout wp-image-1908209 size-full\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gradeup_founders.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gradeup_founders.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gradeup_founders.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gradeup_founders.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gradeup_founders.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gradeup_founders.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gradeup_founders.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1908209\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Co-founders of Noida-based edtech startup Gradeup</p></div></p>\n<p>But still, only a fraction of students take online courses today. One of the roadblocks in their growth has been access to mobile data, which until recent years was fairly expensive in the country. But arrival of Reliance Jio has solved that issue, said Bhatnagar. The other is acceptance from students and more importantly, their parents. Watching a course online on a smartphone or desktop is still a new concept for many parents in the country, he said. But this, too, is beginning to change.</p>\n<p>“The first wave of online solutions were built around on-demand video content, either free or paid. Today, the next wave is online live courses like Gradeup, with teacher-student interactivity, personalisation, and adaptive learning strategies, deliver high-quality solutions that scale, which is particularly valuable in semi-urban and rural markets,” said Times Internet’s Gajwani.</p>\n<p>“These match or better the experience quality of offline education, while being more cost-effective. This trend will keep growing in India, where online live education will grow very quickly for test prep, reskilling, and professional learning,” he added.</p>\n<p>Gradeup has amassed over 15 million registered students who have enrolled to live lectures. The startup plans to use the fresh capital to expand its academic team to 100 faculty members (from 50 currently) and 200 subject matters and reach more users in smaller cities and towns in India.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Students even in smaller cities and towns are paying a hefty amount of fee and are unable to get access to high-quality teachers,&#8221; Bhatnagar said. &#8220;This is exactly the void we can fill.&#8221;</p>\n",

Khosrowshahi called the layoffs a chance to ensure that the company was &#8220;structured for success for the next few years.&#8221; In an email to staff, he wrote, “This has resulted in difficult but necessary changes to ensure we have the right people in the right roles in the right locations, and that we’re always holding ourselves accountable to top performance.”</p>\n<p>With the layoffs behind it, Uber can now focus on some of the big operational challenges it had set for itself through the reorganization that the company has announced.

Today&#8217;s definition of ERP includes finance, HCM (human capital management), projects, procurement, supply chain and asset management,&#8221; Wang told TechCrunch.</p>\n<p>As the Scout RFP founders stated <a href=\"https://www.scoutrfp.com/2019/11/were-just-getting-started/\">in a blog post</a> about today&#8217;s announcement, the two companies have worked well together and a deal made sense. &#8220;Working closely with the Workday team, we realized how similar our companies’ beliefs and values are. Both companies put user experience at the center of product focus and are committed to customer satisfaction, employee engagement and overall business impact. It was not surprising how easy it was to work together and how quickly we saw success partnering on go-to-market activities. From a culture standpoint, it just worked,&#8221; they wrote. A deal eventually came together as a result.</p>\n<p>Scout RFP is a fairly substantial business, with 240 customers in 155 countries. There are 300,000 users on the platform, according to data supplied by the company. The company&#8217;s 160 employees will be moving to Workday when the deal closes, which is expected<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> by the end of January, pending standard regulatory review.</span></p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Vob6w0cQNo\"><p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/07/scout-rfp-raises-15-5-million-to-help-companies-manage-purchases/\">Scout RFP raises $15.5 million to help companies manage purchases</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe title=\"&#8220;Scout RFP raises $15.5 million to help companies manage purchases&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/07/scout-rfp-raises-15-5-million-to-help-companies-manage-purchases/embed/#?secret=Vob6w0cQNo\" data-secret=\"Vob6w0cQNo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></div>\n",
